# Get Better Weight of Evidence of Scorecard by Genetic Algorithm

## Abstract
Scorecard is a very important risk management tool in credit card business. When a client start to apply to
a credit card in a bank, if his scorecard was lower than a cutoff score (e.g. 520), then the bank is going to
reject his apply, vice versa. The WOE (a.k.a weight of evidence) plays the most important role in how to
build a better scorecard to distinct the bad person and good person. This paper is trying to get better
WOE by solving an optimization problem via genetic algorithm.
