# Excelling to Another Level with SAS®

## Abstract
Have you ever wished that with one click (or by submitting a single macro call)
you could copy any SAS® data set, including or excluding either variable names
or labels, and automagically create or modify Microsoft Excel workbooks, or
paste tables into Microsoft Word files or Microsoft PowerPoint presentations?
Or how about doing any of the above but, at the same time, create pivot tables
or base new worksheets on existing Excel templates or pre-formatted workbooks so
that you don’t have to spend time duplicating such things as font usage,
effects, formulas, highlighting, or graphs? You can, and with just Base SAS®.
There are some little known but easy-to-use methods that are available for
automating many of your (or your users') common tasks.
