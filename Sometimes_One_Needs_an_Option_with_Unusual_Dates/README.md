# Sometimes One Needs an Option with Unusual Dates

## Abstract
Do you have date range analytical needs that you haven’t been able to solve
with the SAS® interval and holiday functions? You have if those needs 
involved analyzing a date range that didn’t start at the beginning, end or
middle of a given month, involved holidays other than the US and Canadian
holidays that are incorporated in the holiday function, or if you had to
analyze data related to virtually any annual sporting event. This paper
shows how the intervalds option, introduced in SAS 9.2 phase 2, can be
used to meet such needs and includes code for addressing fiscal years in
Great Britain, Chinese, Hebrew and Islamic holidays, and for analyzing the
various rounds of the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament.
