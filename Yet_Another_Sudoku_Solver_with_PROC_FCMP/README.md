# Yet Another Sudoku Solver: PROC FCMP

## Abstract
There have been many different Sudoku solvers written using various SAS® 
tools (e.g., DATA step, PROC CLP, PROC OPTMODEL with MILP Solver, and 
PROC SQL). This paper introduces yet another tool, PROC FCMP, which can 
be used to solve Sudoku puzzles using recursive functions. A unique
feature of this solver is the inclusion of the ability to determine 
whether a puzzle has a unique solution, which is a necessary step toward
actually generating Sudoku puzzles directly with SAS. Additionally, the
paper presents a comparative analysis of some of the other solutions
that have been proposed.
