# Using the polygon package for IML in place of PROC GINSIDE for calculating point intersection with multiple overlapping polygons

## General

This notebook utilizes the polygon package for IML created by Rick Wicklin in order determine whether any of a set of points are inside a set of non-simple (intersecting) polygons.  In this example we have two overlapping shapes and five points.
